# Execution Preference Rules

## Policy
- Prefer running commands directly to collect output and verify behavior, rather than asking the user to run them.
- Use non-interactive flags and run in the background for long-running tasks.
- Capture logs to the `logs/` directory whenever possible.

## Implementation
- Use PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for local scripts.
- For persistent processes, redirect all streams using `*>` to log files.
- When admin rights are required, detect failure and inform the user clearly.

## Notes
- System: Windows 11 Pro, user path conventions may include spaces.
- Always quote paths with spaces.
