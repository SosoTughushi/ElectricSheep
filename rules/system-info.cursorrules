# System Information

## Hardware Configuration
- **CPU**: Intel Core i7-14700K
  - Physical Cores: 20
  - Logical Processors: 28
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090
  - Driver Version: 32.0.15.8157
- **Integrated Graphics**: Intel UHD Graphics 770
  - Driver Version: 32.0.101.7040

## Operating System
- **OS**: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro
- **Version**: 10.0.26100 Build 26100
- **Architecture**: x64-based PC
- **BIOS**: American Megatrends International, LLC. A.A0 (10/27/2023)

## Notes
- System has multiple GPUs (discrete NVIDIA + integrated Intel)
- High core count CPU may cause issues with applications that don't handle many cores well
- RTX 3090 is a high-end GPU that may trigger driver-level optimizations

## Examples

### Example 1: Checking CPU Affinity - Good Pattern

**Scenario**: Need to check CPU affinity for a process.

**Good:**
```powershell
# Check CPU affinity for process
$process = Get-Process -Name "BambuStudio" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if ($process) {
    $affinity = $process.ProcessorAffinity
    Write-Output "PROCESS: $($process.Name)"
    Write-Output "CPU_AFFINITY: $affinity"
    Write-Output "LOGICAL_PROCESSORS: 28"
    Write-Output "AFFINITY_MASK: $($affinity.ToString('X'))"
} else {
    Write-Output "PROCESS: Not running"
}
```

**Bad:**
```powershell
# Don't check if process exists
# Don't provide structured output
Get-Process BambuStudio | Select-Object ProcessorAffinity
# Unclear output format
```

### Example 2: Handling High Core Count - Good Pattern

**Scenario**: Application doesn't handle 28 logical processors well.

**Good:**
```powershell
# Limit to physical cores only (exclude hyperthreaded)
$physicalCores = 0..19  # 20 physical cores
$affinityMask = 0
foreach ($core in $physicalCores) {
    $affinityMask = $affinityMask -bor [Math]::Pow(2, $core)
}

# Set affinity
$process = Get-Process -Name "BambuStudio"
$process.ProcessorAffinity = [IntPtr]$affinityMask
Write-Output "STATUS: CPU affinity set to physical cores only"
```

**Bad:**
```powershell
# Use all cores without checking
# Don't consider application limitations
# No error handling
```

### Example 3: GPU Selection - Good Pattern

**Scenario**: Need to select appropriate GPU for operation.

**Good:**
```powershell
# Check available GPUs
$gpus = Get-WmiObject Win32_VideoController | Select-Object Name, AdapterRAM

Write-Output "AVAILABLE_GPUS:"
foreach ($gpu in $gpus) {
    Write-Output "  - $($gpu.Name)"
    Write-Output "    RAM: $([Math]::Round($gpu.AdapterRAM / 1GB, 2)) GB"
}

# Select NVIDIA GPU for compute tasks
$nvidiaGpu = $gpus | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*NVIDIA*" }
if ($nvidiaGpu) {
    Write-Output "SELECTED_GPU: NVIDIA (for compute tasks)"
} else {
    Write-Output "SELECTED_GPU: Intel (fallback)"
}
```

**Bad:**
```powershell
# Assume GPU exists
# Don't check availability
# Hardcode GPU selection
```
