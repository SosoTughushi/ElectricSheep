# Bambu Lab Crash Fix

## Problem Description
Bambu Lab application crashes when clicking if all CPU cores are enabled. Requires manual CPU affinity adjustment via Task Manager.

## Root Causes
1. **NVIDIA Threaded Optimization**: NVIDIA driver's threaded optimization feature may conflict with Bambu Lab
2. **High Core Count**: Applications may not handle 28 logical processors well
3. **GPU Driver Conflicts**: Multiple GPUs (NVIDIA + Intel integrated) may cause issues

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Disable NVIDIA Threaded Optimization (Recommended)
- Open NVIDIA Control Panel
- Navigate to: 3D Settings > Manage 3D Settings > Program Settings
- Add Bambu Studio/Bambu Lab to program list
- Set "Threaded Optimization" to "Off"
- Apply and restart application

### Solution 2: Automate CPU Affinity Setting
- Use PowerShell script to automatically set CPU affinity on launch
- Limit to specific subset of cores (e.g., cores 0-15, excluding hyperthreaded cores)
- Script should be run before or during application launch

### Solution 3: Update Drivers
- Ensure NVIDIA drivers are up to date
- Check Bambu Lab application for updates

## Implementation Priority
1. Try Solution 1 first (NVIDIA settings)
2. If that doesn't work, implement Solution 2 (automated affinity)
3. Verify drivers are current
