# Dataset Configuration for Angelina WAN 2.2 Training
# This config is set up for high/low noise training with images

[general]
# Default resolution for all datasets
resolution = [960, 544]

# Caption file extension
caption_extension = ".txt"

# Batch size for training
batch_size = 1

# Enable aspect ratio bucketing (recommended for varied image sizes)
enable_bucket = true

# Don't upscale images - only resize to fit buckets
bucket_no_upscale = false

# Number of times to repeat the dataset (useful for balancing small datasets)
num_repeats = 1

# Dataset configuration
[[datasets]]
# Path to directory containing images
image_directory = "E:/Stable Diffusion/TrainingDataSet/Angeline Jolie"

# Cache directory for pre-processed latents (recommended to set explicitly)
cache_directory = "E:/Stable Diffusion/TrainingDataSet/Angeline Jolie/cache"

# Optional: Override general settings per dataset
# resolution = [960, 544]  # Override if needed
# batch_size = 1           # Override if needed
# num_repeats = 2          # Increase if you want more repetitions

# Note: For WAN 2.2 high/low training:
# - Use --dit_high_noise flag during training to train both models
# - Or train separately with --min_timestep and --max_timestep:
#   - High noise: --min_timestep 875 --max_timestep 1000 (for T2V)
#   - Low noise: --min_timestep 0 --max_timestep 875 (for T2V)
#   - High noise: --min_timestep 900 --max_timestep 1000 (for I2V)
#   - Low noise: --min_timestep 0 --max_timestep 900 (for I2V)
