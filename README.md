# Electric Sheep

Electric Sheep is an innovative .NET application powered by the Actor Model and integrated with ChatGPT. Drawing inspiration from Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", this system is designed to hierarchically decompose complex tasks through a network of actors, each communicating and delegating roles with the aid of ChatGPT.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Actor Model**: Decompose tasks at multiple levels, ensuring modularity and effective task management.
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Enables each actor to communicate and better understand the tasks, facilitating efficient decomposition.
- **Context Persistence**: Actors can save and recall their context, allowing for task resumption and rollback.
